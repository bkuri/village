## Tier 1: High ROI (High Value, Low/Medium Effort)

### Proposal: GitHub Integration

**Problem**:
- Manual PR descriptions are time-consuming
- No consistency in PR format across team
- PR status doesn't sync with Beads task completion
- Manual labeling and organization

**Solution**:
Automate GitHub PR workflows via Village. Provide bidirectional sync between Beads tasks and GitHub PRs.

**Proposal**:
```bash
# Generate PR description from task + git diff
village pr describe bd-a3f8

# Sync PR status with Beads task completion
village pr sync --from-beads
```

**Value**:

**Proposal**:
```bash
# Configuration (in .village/config or environment)
[ci.github_actions]
enabled=true
trigger_on_task_complete=true
notify_on_failure=true
blocking_on_failure=true

# Village automatically triggers on task completion
```

**Value**:
- **Catches regressions early**: Immediate build execution on task completion
- **Prevents merging broken code**: Build failures block dependent tasks

**Solution**:
Webhook-based notification system for critical events (task failures, orphan detection, high-priority task completion).

**Proposal**:
```bash
# Configuration (in .village/config)
[notifications.slack]
enabled=true
webhook_url=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
events=task_failed,orphan_detected,high_priority_task,queue_stalled

[notifications.email]
enabled=false
address=team@example.com
events=task_failed
```

**Value**:
- **Faster incident response**: Immediate awareness of failures
- **Better visibility**: Proactive alerts on critical events
- **Reduced manual monitoring**: No need to check logs constantly
- **Team coordination**: All team members see same notifications

**Effort**: Low (8-12 hours)

**Use Cases**:
- Alert on task failure (with error details)
- Alert on orphan detection (worktrees without locks)
- Alert when queue is stalled (no tasks running)
- Alert on high-priority task completion
- Alert on system anomalies (stale locks, resource exhaustion)

**Integration Points**:
- Village event log hooking system
- Webhook POST requests (Slack, Discord, Email)
- Village status queries (to extract context)
- Beads task metadata (for alert details)

**Risks**:
- Notification service outages (Slack downtime, etc.)
- Webhook failures (rate limits, network issues)
- Spam risk (too many notifications)
- Alert fatigue (too sensitive)

**Alternatives**:
- Manual log monitoring (current approach)
- Terminal-based notifications (desktop notifications)
- Existing monitoring tools (Prometheus alerts, etc.)
- Village status commands (manual polling)

**Dependencies**:
- Webhook endpoints (Slack, Discord, Email)
- Village event log hooking system
- Network connectivity for webhook delivery

## Tier 2: Medium ROI (Medium Value, Medium Effort)

### Proposal: Advanced Scheduling Policies

**Problem**:
- FIFO scheduling doesn't optimize throughput
- No consideration for task priority or impact
- System resources may be underutilized or overloaded
- No fair-share balancing across agents

**Solution**:
Customizable scheduling policies for priority-based, resource-aware, and fair-share task selection.

**Proposal**:
```python
# Configuration (in .village/config or code)
[scheduler]
policy=default

# .village/scheduler.py
def should_schedule(task, active_workers, system_state):
    # Priority-based: High-impact tasks first
    if task.metadata.get("impact") == "high":
        return True, "high priority"
    
    # Resource-aware: Respect CPU/memory limits
    if system_state.load_average > 4.0:
        return False, "system overloaded"
    
    # Fair-share: Balance agent allocation
    agent_load = count_by_agent(active_workers)
    if agent_load.get(task.agent) >= system_state.max_workers:
        return False, "agent overloaded"
    
    return default_policy(task, active_workers, system_state)
```

**Value**:
- **Better resource utilization**: Optimal task ordering based on priority and resources
- **Faster task completion**: High-impact tasks get priority
- **System stability**: Resource-aware scheduling prevents overload
- **Fair allocation**: Balanced workload across agents

**Effort**: Medium (12-16 hours)

**Use Cases**:
- High-priority task steals STALE lock after shorter timeout
- Resource-aware scheduling (respect CPU/memory limits)
- Fair-share scheduling (prevent agent starvation)
- Dependency-aware scheduling (optimal DAG traversal)
- Custom policies per team or project

**Integration Points**:
- System load monitoring (psutil or similar)
- Task metadata (priority tags, impact labels)
- Extend `arbitrate_locks()` in queue.py
- Village config system for policy selection

**Risks**:
- Complexity in scheduling logic
- Tuning required for optimal performance
- Policy conflicts (priority vs fairness trade-offs)
- Resource monitoring inaccuracies

**Alternatives**:
- Manual task prioritization (current approach)
- External schedulers (less integrated)
- Fixed task ordering (no flexibility)
- Single worker (no coordination needed)

**Dependencies**:
- System load monitoring (psutil, htop, etc.)
- Task metadata enriched with priority/impact
- Beads task data with priority fields

**Proposal**:
```bash
village pr describe bd-a3f8
> [Extracts task metadata from Beads]
> [Analyzes git diff in worktree]
> [Generates PR description with:]
>   - Summary (from task title/description)
>   - Changes (git diff summary)
>   - Testing checklist (from task success criteria)
>   - Related tasks (from Beads dependencies)
```

**Value**:
- **Improved PR quality**: Consistent format, complete information
- **Faster PR submission**: Auto-generated, just review and submit
- **Better review process**: Testing checklist ensures quality
- **Traceability**: Links PR back to Beads tasks

**Effort**: Low (8-12 hours)

**Use Cases**:
- Generate PR description for completed task
- Include testing checklist based on task success criteria
- Link to related Beads tasks (dependencies)
- Format: Summary, Changes, Checklist, Related Issues
- Output to stdout (to paste into PR form) or create PR directly

**Integration Points**:
- Beads task data extraction
- Git diff parsing in worktrees
- Markdown formatting for PR description
- GitHub CLI (optional, for direct PR creation)

**Risks**:
- Template quality (generic descriptions)
- Context limitations (git diff alone may miss details)
- Task metadata completeness (requires good task definitions)
- Formatting inconsistencies (different PR requirements)

**Alternatives**:
- Manual PR descriptions (current approach)
- GitHub PR templates (repository-level)
- Existing PR description tools (e.g., release-drafter)
- AI-powered PR descriptions (less integrated)

**Dependencies**:
- Beads tasks with proper metadata
- Git worktree for task
- Village event log (to know task completed)

### Proposal: Multi-Repo Coordination

**Problem**:
- Coordinating tasks across microservices/monorepos is manual
- No unified view of cross-repo dependencies
- Separate Village instances per repo (fragmented coordination)
- Cross-repo task dependencies are manual

**Solution**:
Configurable multi-repo support with shared lock state and unified task routing.

**Proposal**:
```ini
# .village/config
[repo.backend]
path=../backend
agent=backend-build
scm=git

[repo.frontend]
path=../frontend
agent=frontend-build
scm=git

# Commands
village queue --repo backend --n 3
village queue --repo frontend --n 2
village status --repos
```

**Value**:
- **Unified coordination**: Single view across all repositories
- **Cross-repo task routing**: Automatic routing to correct repo
- **Shared lock state**: No duplicate work across repos
- **Microservices support**: Essential for multi-service architectures

**Effort**: High (20-24 hours)

**Use Cases**:
- Queue tasks for backend and frontend simultaneously
- Status view across all repositories
- Cross-repo dependencies (frontend task depends on backend task)
- Different SCM per repo (Git for backend, jj for frontend)
- Shared configuration (max_workers, policies)

**Integration Points**:
- Config parser (multi-repo support)
- Path resolution (relative paths from config)
- Worktree isolation per repo (`.worktrees/backend/bd-a3f8/`)
- Lock state (shared across repos or per-repo)
- Queue scheduler (repo-aware routing)

**Risks**:
- Complex state management across repos
- Path resolution ambiguity (relative vs absolute)
- Worktree isolation conflicts (same task ID in multiple repos)
- Configuration complexity
- Beads task routing (cross-repo dependencies)

**Alternatives**:
- Separate Village instances per repo (current approach)
- Manual cross-repo coordination
- Monorepo with single Village instance
- External coordination tools (less integrated)

**Dependencies**:
- Beads tasks with repo metadata (labels, custom fields)
- Path resolution for multiple repositories
- Per-repo SCM backend (Git, jj, etc.)
- Unified lock state or isolated per-repo locks

---

## Tier 3: Low ROI (Low Value or High Effort)

### Proposal: Resource Quotas

**Problem**:
- No enforcement of resource limits (CPU, memory, disk)
- Resource exhaustion under high load
- Tasks may compete for resources unpredictably
- No visibility into resource usage

**Solution**:
Enforce resource quotas per agent (CPU, memory, disk) with pre-flight checks.

**Proposal**:
```ini
# .village/config
[resources]
max_cpu=4.0
max_memory_gb=16
max_disk_gb=50

[agent.build]
quota_cpu=2.0
quota_memory_gb=8
quota_disk_gb=20
```

**Value**:
- **Production reliability**: Prevents resource exhaustion
- **Stable performance**: Predictable resource allocation
- **Fair resource distribution**: Quotas prevent resource hogging
- **Capacity planning**: Clear limits enable better forecasting

**Effort**: High (16-20 hours)

**Use Cases**:
- CPU limits per agent (prevent CPU starvation)
- Memory limits per agent (prevent OOM kills)
- Disk limits per task (prevent disk exhaustion)
- Pre-flight checks before claiming tasks
- Resource-aware scheduling (respect quotas)

**Integration Points**:
- System load monitoring (psutil, /proc/loadavg)
- Memory monitoring (psutil, /proc/meminfo)
- Disk usage monitoring (psutil, df)
- Extend `arbitrate_locks()` in queue.py (quota checks)

**Risks**:
- Monitoring inaccuracies (resource reporting errors)
- Quota tuning complexity (optimal values differ per workload)
- False positives (prevent valid work due to quota)
- Resource monitoring overhead (performance impact)

**Alternatives**:
- External resource limits (cgroups, containers)
- Manual resource management
- System-level resource quotas (OS-level)
- No resource limits (current approach, accept exhaustion risk)

**Dependencies**:
- Resource monitoring tools (psutil, /proc)
- Village config system for quota definitions
- System access for resource queries

### Proposal: Dynamic DAG Re-evaluation

**Problem**:
- Stale Beads DAG state may cause incorrect scheduling
- Static DAG queries don't reflect runtime changes
- Manual Beads updates required when DAG changes
- Dependencies may be outdated

**Solution**:
Re-calculate task readiness at queue time by querying Beads DAG and resolving dependencies dynamically.

**Proposal**:
```python
# village/dag_reeval.py
def generate_queue_plan(session_name, max_workers):
    # Re-evaluate dependencies (Beads might be stale)
    tasks = get_beads_ready()
    
    for task in tasks:
        dependencies = get_beads_dependencies(task.id)
        if not all_dependencies_satisfied(dependencies):
            tasks.remove(task)
    
    return tasks

# Beads sync
village sync --to-beads
```

**Value**:
- **Marginal improvement**: Current Beads integration works well
- **Runtime correctness**: Always uses latest DAG state
- **Reduced manual work**: No need to manually refresh Beads
- **Dependency accuracy**: Correct task ordering based on current state

**Effort**: High (16-20 hours)

**Use Cases**:
- Re-calculate readiness at queue time
- Detect stale Beads DAG state
- Optimize task ordering based on current dependencies
- Sync Village lock status back to Beads
- Update task statuses (CLAIMED, IN_PROGRESS, FAILED) in Beads

**Integration Points**:
- Beads DAG API (tasks, dependencies, status)
- Village queue scheduler (dynamic re-evaluation)
- Beads task status update API
- Village event log (sync events to Beads)

**Risks**:
- Beads API changes require updates
- Performance impact (DAG queries can be expensive)
- Complex dependency resolution logic
- Stale data caching (if queries are too frequent)

**Alternatives**:
- Static Beads DAG queries (current approach)
- Manual Beads refresh (when DAG changes)
- External task management (less integrated)
- Cached DAG with manual invalidation

**Dependencies**:
- Beads DAG API access
- Beads task status update API
- Beads CLI installed and configured

## Proposal Evaluation Framework (For Future Consideration)

When evaluating proposals for implementation, consider:

### ROI Alignment
- Does it solve real user pain?
- Is implementation cost justified?
- Can it be done simply?
- High, Medium, or Low ROI?

### Safety Guarantee
- Can it violate Village's core principles?
- Does it introduce hidden state?
- Is it transparent and inspectable?
- Can Village work without it?

### Optional Nature
- Can Village work without it?
- Is it opt-in?
- Does it increase complexity for non-users?
- Are scope boundaries clear?

### Maintainability
- Does it bloat the codebase?
- Is it well-scoped?
- Can it be tested independently?
- Clear separation of concerns?

### User Control
- Does the human remain in control?
- Can outputs be reviewed/edited?
- Is invocation explicit?
- Configurable behavior?

---

## Summary

Village's core value is **coordination infrastructure** with audit trails, safety guarantees, and production reliability. Optional extensions may enhance productivity but must never compromise Village's core guarantees:

- Village remains the scheduler
- Humans remain in control
- State remains file-based and inspectable
- No magic, no hidden processes, no side effects

When in doubt, keep it simple. A small, reliable coordination tool is better than a complex, feature-rich one.

**Current Status**: Village v0.2.3 (Jujutsu support complete)
**Next Target**: v0.3.0 (Safety & Coordination - Essential)
**Production Goal**: v1.0.0 (Production-ready coordination layer)
